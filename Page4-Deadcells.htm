Kill, Die, Learn, Repeat. That is how you beat the whole game, thats it. I love this game too but it's not kinda popular but does that matter? No of course not.</font></h6></th></tr>
      <th><h6><font color="#93FFE8" face="Courier">This game has a DLC which is called Return to Castlevania, it's not only the only DLC this game has, it has more like Fatal Falls, The Bad Seed, and more. And this DLC has of a new biomes, enemies, bosses, and items. I think these DLCs made the game better because all the new weapons you can use them for setups or builds in one go and others are overpowered as hell.</font></h6></th>
