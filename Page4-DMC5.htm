This game has a special edition which is my favorite part of this game because what the special edition does is it adds Vergil as a playable character. The main reason why is the fans want him to be a playable character due to his immense popularity among fans and Vergil has always been a fan-favorite character, and now he's added as a playable character in the game.</font></h6></th>
